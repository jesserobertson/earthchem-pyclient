### So why would I want to use this?

Gonna come up with a good reason for this here....

### Great, I'm sold. How do I get it?

Provided you have python installed, this library is just a `pip install earthchem` away. 

If you don't have Python we recommend taking a look at the marvellous [Anaconda distribution](https://www.anaconda.com/) - just pick your relevant platform download [from here](https://www.anaconda.com/download/).
